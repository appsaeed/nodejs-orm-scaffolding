## NodeJS ORM Scaffolding

The scaffolding tries to extend some features to feel like Laravel

We used [knex](http://www.npmjs.com/package/knex) package to query builder and database schema created in NodeJS project, and We also used [express.js](http://www.npmjs.com/package/https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) for routing, middleware

With the help of knex, express, and this source, we can easily fast forward to develop our project focused and  jump to business logic
